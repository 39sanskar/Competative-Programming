/* a pointer is a variable which is going to hold an address of some other variable.
>>assign address of any variable to any pointer.(but it is a good practice always use 
the same type)

>> if you want to store a address of a character always use the character pointer.
because of pointer arithmetic.

>> sometimes we dont know what is the type of the memory then 
what we generally use is (void*).
void pointer is use to hold a varaible of anytype.
>> nullptr is asign only to pointer(*p). it is not assign any variable.

>>fact>>in C++ , C , JAVA => int arr3[6] = arr2 (it is not allowed.for any array)
